## Purpose of generate_data folder
This folder is created in order to guarantee reproducibility. Within this folder, there will be code that extracts and organises data directly from official sources.

The files in the data/input come from official sources. The files in the data/output folder will be copied to the data in the package when deemed necessary. The sources of each file will be explained in the Codebook section below.

Note an important convention: all data used in the package will be copied with the same name as it has in this folder, except when doing so would lead to repeated file names. In those cases, their original filename will be detailed below.

### Codebook

#### Output
- general_data.pkl, results_by_province.pkl
  - generated by prepare_results.py
  - data source: input/PROV_02_201911_1.xlsx
- dict_acronym_name.json
  - generated by get_full_names.py
  - data source: input/PROV_02_201911_1.xlsx
- n_seats.json
  - generated by get_n_seats.py
  - data source: output/general_data.pkl

#### Package Data
